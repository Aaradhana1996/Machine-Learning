Cosmetics Dataset:
All cosmetic companies in California are required to report their products (since 2005) if they could cause cancer, developmental birth defects, or harm the reproductive system. This dataset contains information about them: company names, chemical names, cosmetic types, date product was registered, date product was discontinued (if it was) etc...

Automobile Insurance Dataset:
This dataset is about automobiles and insurance information related to that. The target variable is normalized losses (relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year), and there were 25 predictors involved. Since the list is too long, I have simply attached an excel document in case anyone is interested. 

Module 8 uses the Microsoft website dataset and more information about it can be found in the module 8 description document.
